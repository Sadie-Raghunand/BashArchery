Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get past loading screen + make sure game works in actual game //Tertiary Task// 

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI 
		
Bugs:

	*First move is drastically slower than others 
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable 	right now

	*Rotation w/keyboard has no limits + cam doesn't move with it, good for debugging right now but if keyboard support 	needs to be implemented, then this needs to be fixed

	*Arrow indicators layer properly, though distances need to be experimented with, but they displace on the world x axis, 	need to displace on the player's relative x axis


		
Polish:
	*UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc 	//Primary Task//

	*Continue to improve arrow movement 
		
	*Try to completely freeze target rings //Secondary Task//

	*Add UI for which way the wind is blowing / Ui to indicate when the wind changes?

	*Add beginning + end cutscenes

	*Switch to Unreal 5.6

	*Juice ideas:
		- Don't automatically move target, leave it there w/ arrow, freeze arrow when hitting the target
		- Make target physically respond to being hit



Done today:
Arrows stick to the target, mostly working on this and debugging the issues that come up with it 
Start working on target movement feedback when hit
Upgrade project to 5.6


Working on:
Positioning light + strong flex indicators correctly along axis between player and end of line trace
Improving target feedback when an arrow hits it by pausing when an arrow hits it before moving positions, keeping arrows in the target where they hit, and making the target have slight movement when hit, mainly trying to freeze the arrow in place rn




---Needed for game:---
Environmental art assets
Art assets for the targets, bow, and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
Shooting animation
