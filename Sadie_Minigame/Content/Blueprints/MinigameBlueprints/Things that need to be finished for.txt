Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get passed loading screen + make sure game works in actual game 

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI //Tertiary Task//
		
Bugs:
	*First move is drastically slower than others 

	*All arrows barely move on spawn //Current Task//
		- The actual arrow object doesn't move, the collider does?
	
Polish:
	*UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc
	
	*Finetune arrow movement to be a bit more directional
	
	*Try to completely freeze target rings //Secondary Task//
	
	*Make arrow fall after it runs out of force instead of keeping its 	velocity always


Done today:
Camera gets automatically positioned over the player's shoulder, works with multiple players
Adjust arrows to be shot by player position, not camera position
Fix a minor bug with detecting if the player has already shot an arrow
Fix issue with spawning too many arrows if input is spammed
Fix bug that arose with the arrows going the wrong direction
Fix arrows travelling too slow with controller
Fix bug with passing actor in as self2 variable
Have rotation reset to edge of range when controller is out of the range of rotation to avoid camera getting stuck

Working on:
Adding a visual indicator on where the arrow would land once shot
Fixing arrows not moving

Environmental art assets
