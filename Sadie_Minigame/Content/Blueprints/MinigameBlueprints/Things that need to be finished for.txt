	*Finetune arrow movement to be a bit more directional
	
	*Try to completely freeze target rings
  	
	*Implement thing for player appearing, camera over character's shoulder

Done today:
Fixed no read on rotation
Adjust rotation function to take the correct values from the rotation of the controller and smooth out the speed of rotation
Make controller work with shooting arrows, switch from analog to light/medium/strong flex input
Some basic cleanup of blueprints
Adjusted how arrows move forward to integrate with controller flexing better
Fix arrows interfering with the player collider
Put in failsafe to prevent player from spamming in one direction before target moves

Currently testing force on start for arrows

Needed for game:
Environmental art assets
Art assets for the targets and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
