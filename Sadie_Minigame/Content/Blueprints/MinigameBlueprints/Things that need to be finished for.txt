Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get past loading screen + make sure game works in actual game  

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI 
		
Bugs:

	*First move is drastically slower than others 
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable 	right now

	*Rotation w/keyboard has no limits + cam doesn't move with it, good for debugging right now but if keyboard support 	needs to be implemented, then this needs to be fixed

	*Arrow indicators layer properly, though distances need to be experimented with, but they displace on the world x axis, 	need to displace on the player's relative x axis

	*Project keeps crashing but only when I am away from it for like 5+ minutes

Bugs SPECIFICALLY FROM UPGRADING TO 5.6 //Primary Task//

	*Defaults to first turn is player 1, not 0

	*Twice as many players spawn in

	*Particle effect is a square - low priority
		
Polish: 	

	*Continue to improve arrow movement 
		
	*Try to completely freeze target rings //Tertiary Task//

	*Add UI for which way the wind is blowing / Ui to indicate when the wind changes?

	*Add beginning + end cutscenes

	*Juice ideas: //Secondary Task//
		- Make target physically respond to being hit



Done today:
Fix particle effect materials gone missing after 5.6
Continue working on target movement feedback
Working on multiple player spawns issue
Got a bounce function to work sort of on target but not really? Visual indication is messed up, we'll call it a bug

Working on:
Fixing 5.6 upgrade bugs  is top priority, but also working on trying to enable constraints on target rings in a  way where the z axis is the only thing that can move
	- prevent the rings from colliding if they don't already have that function?




---Needed for game:---
Environmental art assets
Art assets for the targets, bow, and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
Shooting animation
