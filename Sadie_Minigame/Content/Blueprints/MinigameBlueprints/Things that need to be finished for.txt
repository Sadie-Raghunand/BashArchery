Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get passed loading screen + make sure game works in actual game 

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI //Tertiary Task//
		
Bugs:
	*First move is drastically slower than others 

	*Destroy at distance not working now?
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents 	up + down
	
Polish:
	*UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc 	//Secondary Task//
	
	*Finetune arrow movement to be a bit more directional/replicate arrow 	movement better //Current task//
		- Works for sure, but arrow needs to destroy when it hits the 			ground
		- A bit floaty and weird
		
	*Try to completely freeze target rings
