Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get passed loading screen + make sure game works in actual game 

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI //Tertiary Task//
		
Bugs:
	*First move is drastically slower than others 

	*Destroy at distance not working now?
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents 	up + down
	
Polish:
	*UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc 	//Primary Task//
	
	*Continue to improve arrow movement //Secondary Task//
		
	*Try to completely freeze target rings 

	*Players cannot hit other targets, have assigned target


Done today:
Arrow gets destroyed when it hits the floor
Learning about vfx in unreal/Niagara particle systems for use on shoot indicator
	Got working a beam effect that relatively accurately shows where arrow lands and can change the rotation of it to 	replicate player, working on how to get it to change length during runtime
Prevent player from shooting targets that are not in its assigned lane


Working on:
Adding a visual indicator on where the arrow would land once shot
	Working on trying to change were start and end points of the beam are during runtime
	Try checking system properties when you click the atual nodes in the particle effect, emmiter summary?


Needed for game:
Environmental art assets
Art assets for the targets, bow, and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
Shooting animation
