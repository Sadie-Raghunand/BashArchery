Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get passed loading screen + make sure game works in actual game 

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI //Tertiary Task//
		
Bugs:
	*First move is drastically slower than others 

	*Destroy at distance not working now?
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable 	right now
	
Polish:
	*UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc 	//Primary Task//
	
	*Continue to improve arrow movement //Secondary Task//
		
	*Try to completely freeze target rings 


Done today:
Find and fix a bug with arrows not destroying on the ground and resetting game
Work a bit on arrow movement, push back to almost last priority
Pivot approach to arrow indicator, got raycast/line trace to work to determine approximate location in front of player on target
VFX appear at point where the line trace hits the target


Working on:
Making a curved pattern that follows where the arrow actually will go/hit the target

Needed for game:
Environmental art assets
Art assets for the targets, bow, and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
Shooting animation
