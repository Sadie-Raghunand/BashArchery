!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---Tasks organized by urgency---
1.Lack of collision b/w arrows and targets
2.Camera is not set in right place due to lack of players until end of start cutscene
3.Get UI to work w/existing bash UI
4.Implement different forces for keyboard/controller to mimic flex strengths for arrows
4.Try to smooth out camera movement + add to cutscenes
5.Fix arrow indicator layering
6.Juice + polish

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
------------------------
--------------
Done today:
Fix double player spawn issue
Fix keyboard rotation
Fix cutscene and player turn ui infinite loop bug and improve w/ widget animations, finish end cutscene UI animations
Work on new and improved(!) arrow/target collision bug

Working on:
Working on cutscenes - next is camera movement + any adding art assets that is necessary for  this to look good
Working on arrows not colliding with targets at high speeds

---------------


Bugs:

	*First move is drastically slower than others (FTC Tween?)
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable 	right now

	*Arrow indicators layer properly, though distances need to be experimented with, but they displace on the world x axis, 	need to displace on the player's relative x axis
		- Arrow indicators also depend on position of the forwardPos object, either this or arrow destroying needs to 		be independent of that

	*Project keeps crashing but only when I am away from it for like 5+ minutes

	*Arrows never destroy, and are never registered as hit by target
		-Directly related to the newfound speed of the arrows, plus lerp does not seem to inherently take into account 		physics
		-Maybe make it so when arrow is further than the target, stop moving forward, then force downwards to hit 		ground?
		-Or halfway between the forward pos & player? Except this ignores the force that the players flex w
Polish: 	

	*Juice ideas: //Tertiary Task//
		- Use FTC Tween plugin (possibly go back and polish target and camera movement with this)

	*Cutscenes //Secondary Task//
		-Ideas:
			+Aerial zoom in/out to position in front of target?
			+End cutscene revolves camera around the player that won/winning player's target w/arrows on it w Ui 			that says who won?
			+Will likely need the 5.6 bugs fixed before testing on this can be properly done
			!!Implemented needs testing : UI telling which player's turn it is, plus start text, plus end text
			!!!For loop does not work w/delay use branch??!!!

	*Add consideration for how to differentiate between flexes for controller/keyboard (time held? Force on thumbstick?) 

	*UI to show how many points each player has gotten + how many arrows they have left

	*UI to show when a player has changed the wind + which player

	*LAST (or add debug mode for this) allow all players to shoot through player 1 during practice mode, then go to normal 	once practice mode is done




---Needed for game:---
Art assets for the targets, bow, and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
Shooting animation
