Things that need to be finished for archery game
	Get passed loading screen + make sure game works in actual game 	SECONDARY TASK
	Fix wind UI to work w/game UI
Delete the strange extra levels that keep popping up?
	
Bugs:
	First move is drastically slower than others (TERTIARY TASK)
	self 2add point function occasionally causes error, not found cause yet
	Rotation from flex controller is not read CURRENT TASK
	First flex seems to release an arrow, after that nothing		
	
Polish:
	UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc
	Finetune arrow movement to be a bit more directional
	Revisit arrows colliding w/each  other
	Try to completely freeze target rings


Done today:
Fix camera position starting off in the incorrect rotation and offsetting rotation while moving
Fix targets only teleporting forward
Get rid of instantaneous movement after third arrow is shot, waits for arrow to go too far or hit the target to move the camera/change turns
Made progress on getting rotation to be read by game and used for changing arrow aim

Needed for game:
Environmental art assets
Art assets for the targets and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
