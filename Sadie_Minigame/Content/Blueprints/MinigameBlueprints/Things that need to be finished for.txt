!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---Tasks organized by urgency---
1.Camer not overlooking shoulder of first player
2.lack of destroying arrows & making sure force w flexes still works & Arrow freezing in strange places
	-And also finicky collisions
2.Implement different forces for keyboard/controller to mimic flex strengths for arrows
3.Figure out how to test actual  game/w multiple players
4.Get UI to work w/existing bash UI
5.Try to smooth out camera movement + add to cutscenes
6.Fix arrow indicator layering
7.Juice + polish

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
------------------------
--------------
Done today:
Fix camera not going to player's positions when not in practice mode
Fix players after practice mode not being registered by turn manager
	NOTE - setting proper player numbers will require testing, how to do this
Fix arrows missing the target but not really apparently
Fix arrows not destroying at correct distance, in the event they do not hit the ground
Working on cam overlooking first player
Worked on cutscene camera movement and destroying all arrows between practice + game

Working on:
Cutscene camera movement + cam not looking over the player's shoulder
arrow target interactions



---------------


Bugs:

	*First move is drastically slower than others (FTC Tween?)
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable 	right now

	*Arrow indicators layer properly, though distances need to be experimented with, but they displace on the world x axis, 	need to displace on the player's relative x axis
		- Arrow indicators also depend on position of the forwardPos object, either this or arrow destroying needs to 		be independent of that

	*Project keeps crashing but only when I am away from it for like 5+ minutes

	*Arrows never destroy, and are never registered as hit by target
		-Directly related to the newfound speed of the arrows, plus lerp does not seem to inherently take into account 		physics
		-Maybe make it so when arrow is further than the target, stop moving forward, then force downwards to hit 		ground?
		-Or halfway between the forward pos & player? Except this ignores the force that the players flex w
		-Ok they occasionally collide, unfortunately seems to be an issue of luck
Polish: 	

	*Juice ideas: //Tertiary Task//
		- Use FTC Tween plugin (possibly go back and polish target and camera movement with this)

	*Cutscenes //Secondary Task//
		-Ideas:
			+Aerial zoom in/out to position in front of target?
			+End cutscene revolves camera around the player that won/winning player's target w/arrows on it 			testing : UI telling which player's turn it is, plus start text, plus end tex	

	*Add consideration for how to differentiate between flexes for controller/keyboard (time held? Force on thumbstick?) 

	*UI to show how many points each player has gotten + how many arrows they have left

	*UI to show when a player has changed the wind + which player

	*LAST (or add debug mode for this) allow all players to shoot through player 1 during practice mode, then go to normal 	once practice mode is done




---Needed for game:---
Art assets for the targets, bow, and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
Shooting animation
