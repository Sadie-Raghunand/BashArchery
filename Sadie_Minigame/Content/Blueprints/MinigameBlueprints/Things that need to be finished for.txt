Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get past loading screen + make sure game works in actual game //Tertiary Task// 

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI 
		
Bugs:
	*Oh no the shooting in the correct direction is broken again	

	*First move is drastically slower than others 
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable 	right now

	*Rotation w/keyboard has no limits + cam doesn't move with it, good for debugging right now but if keyboard support 	needs to be implemented, then this needs to be fixed

		
Polish:
	*UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc 	//Primary Task//
		-Include wind calculations + strength of flex

	*Continue to improve arrow movement 
		
	*Try to completely freeze target rings //Secondary Task//

	*Add UI for which way the wind is blowing / Ui to indicate when the wind changes?

	*Add beginning + end cutscenes

	*Switch to Unreal 5.6



Done today:
Got trajectory indicator to  follow player's forward and added ability to scale though not actively implemented to leave room for possibility of added 3 different indicators for light- heavy flexes 
Learn a bit about materials and sprites for particle effects in unreal to make different colored in indicators
Add wind into calculation for landing position


Working on:
Traj.Ind ends only at pt. where obj. is, needs to go further or shorter depending on the strength + wind, need to use obj. as an indicator, not actual position 
VFX is also slightly higher than the end of linecast






---Needed for game:---
Environmental art assets
Art assets for the targets, bow, and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
Shooting animation
