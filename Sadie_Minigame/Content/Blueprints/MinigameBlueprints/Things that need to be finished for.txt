Things that need to be finished for archery game
	Get passed loading screen + make sure game works in actual game 	SECONDARY TASK
	Fix wind UI to work w/game UI
	
Bugs:
	First move is drastically slower than others
	self 2add point function occasionally causes error, not found cause yet
	Target rings do not change position it looks like only target parent 	does CURRENT TASK	
		Breakdown of what's happening:
			If you try to manually move the parent, it unparents 				rings from it
			Actual parent seems to move?? But rings dont even though 			y are childed and remain so after movement via blueprint
			If change the position via blueprint, does not unparent
		

TEST W/ ACTUAL CONTROLLER 6/6/25 latest! Test ---flex and rotation---
Also need to test w/multiple players

Polish:
	UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc
	Finetune arrow movement to be a bit more directional
	Revisit arrows colliding w/each  other


Done today:
Fix lack of parenting on target rings
Fix target parent not moving on collision
Get target rings to move, just not in the correct spot
Mostly just detective work on this one bug really, but much closer to fixing I feel like
Worked on bug with point allocation
