Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get passed loading screen + make sure game works in actual game 

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI //Tertiary Task//
		
Bugs:
	*First move is drastically slower than others 

	*All arrows barely move on spawn //Current Task//
		- The actual arrow object doesn't move, the collider does?
		- Make mesh root, now moves wrong way and collider doesn't move, 		assigns points regardless
	
Polish:
	*UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc
	
	*Finetune arrow movement to be a bit more directional
	
	*Try to completely freeze target rings //Secondary Task//
	
	*Make arrow fall after it runs out of force instead of keeping its 	velocity always

Adding a visual indicator on where the arrow would land once shot
