Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get past loading screen + make sure game works in actual game  

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI 

	*Add assets
		
Bugs:

	*First move is drastically slower than others 
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable 	right now

	*Rotation w/keyboard has no limits + cam doesn't move with it, good for debugging right now but if keyboard support 	needs to be implemented, then this needs to be fixed

	*Arrow indicators layer properly, though distances need to be experimented with, but they displace on the world x axis, 	need to displace on the player's relative x axis

	*Project keeps crashing but only when I am away from it for like 5+ minutes

Bugs SPECIFICALLY FROM UPGRADING TO 5.6 //Primary Task//

	*Defaults to first turn is player 1, not 0
		- This may actually bring in another issue of ensuring the correct player starts off and has control, and the 		camera goes to the right spot and the correct players spawn in correct places
		Right now: camera goes to first player's position, but follows rotation of the second player.  Rotating with 		input 	causes second player to rotate, not first
		- Input is tied to first player, might be a thing of input just ties itself to the last player spawned (yeah 		looks like it)

	*Twice as many players spawn in

	*Particle effect is a square - low priority
		
Polish: 	

	*Continue to improve arrow movement 
		
	*Try to completely freeze target rings 

	*Add UI for which way the wind is blowing / Ui to indicate when the wind changes?

	*Add beginning + end cutscenes

	*Juice ideas: //Tertiary Task//
		- Use FTC Tween plugin (possibly go back and polish target and camera movement with this)

	*Cutscenes //Secondary Task//
