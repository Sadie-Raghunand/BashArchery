Things that need to be finished for archery game
	Get passed loading screen + make sure game works in actual game 	SECONDARY TASK
	Fix wind UI to work w/game UI
	
Bugs:
	First move is drastically slower than others
	self 2add point function occasionally causes error, not found cause yet
	Rotation from flex controller is not read
	Not sure if the flex actually releases an arrow?

Polish:
	UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc
	Finetune arrow movement to be a bit more directional
	Revisit arrows colliding w/each  other


Done today:
set targets that are not assigned to a player (ie there are only two players and 4 targets) inactive
Fix target rings not moving
Seems to have fixed target moving on its own after being hit?
Started working on getting flex controller to work with game



Needed for game:
Environmental art assets
Art assets for the targets and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
