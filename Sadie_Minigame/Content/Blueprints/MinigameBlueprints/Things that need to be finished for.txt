Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get past loading screen + make sure game works in actual game  

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI 

Bugs:

	*First move is drastically slower than others (FTC Tween?)
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable 	right now

	*Rotation now only gets clocked by editor if click on object in outliner

	*Arrow indicators layer properly, though distances need to be experimented with, but they displace on the world x axis, 	need to displace on the player's relative x axis

	*Project keeps crashing but only when I am away from it for like 5+ minutes

	*Arrows never destroy, and are never registered as hit by target
		-Directly related to the newfound speed of the arrows, plus lerp does not seem to inherently take into account 		physics



Bugs SPECIFICALLY FROM UPGRADING TO 5.6

	*Particle effect is a square - very low priority
		
Polish: 	

	*Juice ideas: //Tertiary Task//
		- Use FTC Tween plugin (possibly go back and polish target and camera movement with this)

	*Cutscenes //Secondary Task//
		-Ideas:
			+Aerial zoom in/out to position in front of target?
			+End cutscene revolves camera around the player that won/winning player's target w/arrows on it w Ui 			that says who won?
			+Will likely need the 5.6 bugs fixed before testing on this can be properly done
			!!Implemented needs testing : UI telling which player's turn it is, plus start text, plus end text

	*Add consideration for how to differentiate between flexes for controller/keyboard (time held? Force on thumbstick?) 

	*UI to show how many points each player has gotten + how many arrows they have left

	*UI to show when a player has changed the wind + which player

	*LAST (or add debug mode for this) allow all players to shoot through player 1 during practice mode, then go to normal 	once practice mode is done



Done today:
Fix double player spawn issue
Fix keyboard rotation


Working on:
Fixing 5.6 upgrade bugs is top priority
	- Making a function in game mode to find all controllers, trying to find if there's a way to delete any players not 	connected to a controller then reload?
Working on cutscenes - next is camera movement + any adding art assets that is necessary for  this to look good
Working on arrows not colliding with targets at high speeds
Note - Temporarily disconnected the player change wind function and made layer shoot to debug shooting direction! Do not panic when wind doesn't work!
And also setting camera rotation


---Needed for game:---
Art assets for the targets, bow, and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
Shooting animation
