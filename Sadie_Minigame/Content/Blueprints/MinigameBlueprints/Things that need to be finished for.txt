Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get past loading screen + make sure game works in actual game //Tertiary Task// 

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI 
		
Bugs:
	*Oh no the shooting in the correct direction is broken again	

	*First move is drastically slower than others 
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable 	right now

	*Rotation w/keyboard has no limits + cam doesn't move with it, good for debugging right now but if keyboard support 	needs to be implemented, then this needs to be fixed

		
Polish:
	*UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc 	//Primary Task//

	*Continue to improve arrow movement 
		
	*Try to completely freeze target rings //Secondary Task//

	*Add UI for which way the wind is blowing / Ui to indicate when the wind changes?

	*Add beginning + end cutscenes

	*Switch to Unreal 5.6



Done today:
Got trajectory indicator to  follow player's forward and added ability to scale though not actively implemented to leave room for possibility of added 3 different indicators for light- heavy flexes 
Learn a bit about materials and sprites for particle effects in unreal to make different colored in indicators
Add wind into calculation for landing position
Get started on making two other indicators to display strong and light flexes 


Working on:
VFX is also slightly higher than the end of linecast
Set up several indicators, one for light flex, one for medium flex, and one for heavy flex.  Working on getting the positions to be along the same linecast direction, but in front of each other if they do not all hit the target.  Set up separate linecatss, need to set all positions to the same if they all or more than one hit the target, ad set all to line trace at different positions if none hit position.  Also needs testing.  Also update slideshow w/archery game






---Needed for game:---
Environmental art assets
