Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get past loading screen + make sure game works in actual game //Tertiary Task// 

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI 
		
Bugs:
	*First move is drastically slower than others 
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable right now

	*Augmenting linetrace w/angle causes linetrace to not follow player's forward

		
Polish:
	*UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc 	//Primary Task//
		-Curved or calculate angle, see below
		-Include wind calculations + strength of flex
		- Backup plan: just do forward vector and pass off as ballparking where the forward is, then 			player has to 	figure out the rest themselves

	*Continue to improve arrow movement 
		
	*Try to completely freeze target rings //Secondary Task//

	*Add UI for which way the wind is blowing / Ui to indicate when the wind changes?


Done today:
Fix bug with not destroying at a certain distance
Fix player defaulting to a tilted rotation
Fix displaced position of particles on target
Fix bug where particles of Niagara system are invisible
Work on behavior of vfx if the linecast is hitting nothing, got rotation with linecast done
Fix bug with updating the particle effect's position
Set up/working on basis for system to account for angle of arrow instead of being a straight shot from the player for the indicator, working on adjusting math and values to make more accurate and working on getting it to actually follow that pattern


Working on:
The linecast doesn't seem to actually be following the angle, but angle calculations seem right? Not set in stone but the base idea seems to function





---Needed for game:---
Environmental art assets
Art assets for the targets, bow, and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
Shooting animation
