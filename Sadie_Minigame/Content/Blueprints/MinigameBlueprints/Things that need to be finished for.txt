Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get past loading screen + make sure game works in actual game  

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI 

Bugs:

	*First move is drastically slower than others (FTC Tween?)
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable 	right now

	*Rotation now only gets clocked by editor if click on object in outliner

	*Arrow indicators layer properly, though distances need to be experimented with, but they displace on the world x axis, 	need to displace on the player's relative x axis

	*Project keeps crashing but only when I am away from it for like 5+ minutes

	*Arrows never destroy, and are never registered as hit by target

	*When using keyboard, camera doesn't rotate w/player

Bugs SPECIFICALLY FROM UPGRADING TO 5.6 //Primary Task//

	*Defaults to first turn is player 1, not 0
		Right now: camera goes to first player's position, but follows rotation of the second player.  Rotating with 		input 	causes second player to rotate, not first
		- Note: Not a bug just a note, input automatically ties to last player spawned in

	*Twice as many players spawn in
		- Only one bash controller is spawned in however

	*Particle effect is a square - very low priority
		
Polish: 	

	*Juice ideas: //Tertiary Task//
		- Use FTC Tween plugin (possibly go back and polish target and camera movement with this)

	*Cutscenes //Secondary Task//
		-Ideas:
			+Aerial zoom in/out to position in front of target?
			+End cutscene revolves camera around the player that won/winning player's target w/arrows on it w Ui 			that says who won?
			+Will likely need the 5.6 bugs fixed before testing on this can be properly done
			!!Implemented needs testing : UI telling which player's turn it is, plus start text, plus end text

	*Add consideration for how to differentiate between flexes for controller/keyboard (time held? Force on thumbstick?) 

	*UI to show how many points each player has gotten + how many arrows they have left

	*UI to show when a player has changed the wind + which player

	*LAST (or add debug mode for this) allow all players to shoot through player 1 during practice mode, then go to normal 	once practice mode is done



Done today:
Worked on multiple player bug
Fix non-first players spawning behind targets
Fix issue with arrows not setting their player variables to the correct player and subsequently the arrows following the wrong players' shooting direction
Fix hit vfx happening at the wrong time


Working on:
Fixing 5.6 upgrade bugs is top priority
	- Making a function in game mode to find all controllers, trying to find if there's a way to delete any players not 	connected to a controller then reload?
Working on cutscenes - next is camera movement + any adding art assets that is necessary for  this to look good
Working on arrows not colliding with targets at high speeds
Note - Temporarily disconnected the player change wind function and made layer shoot to debug shooting direction! Do not panic when wind doesn't work!
And also setting camera rotation


---Needed for game:---
Art assets for the targets, bow, and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
Shooting animation
