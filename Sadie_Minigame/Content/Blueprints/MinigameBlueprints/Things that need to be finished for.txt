Things that need to be finished for archery game
	*Get passed loading screen + make sure game works in actual game 

	*Fix wind UI to work w/game UI //Tertiary Task//
		
Bugs:
	*First move is drastically slower than others 

	*Destroy at distance not working now?
	
	*Applying up + down movement prevents forward movement forward prevents up + down, Last priority since it is workable 	right now

	*VFX only appear on linecast where linecast first goes, des not update on tick
	
Polish:
	*UI or something to show aim of arrow, how far pulled back it is, etc 	//Primary Task//
		-Curved or calculate angle, see below
		-Include wind calculations + strength of flex
		- Backup plan: just do forward vector and pass off as ballparking where the forward is, then player has to 		figure out the rest themselves
	
	*Continue to improve arrow movement //Secondary Task//
		
	*Try to completely freeze target rings 


Done today:
Find and fix a bug with arrows not destroying on the ground and resetting game
Work a bit on arrow movement, push back to almost last priority
Pivot approach to arrow indicator, got raycast/line trace to work to determine approximate location in front of player on target
VFX appear at point where the line trace hits the target
Working on calculating an angle to more acturately reflect where the arrow will land 


Working on:
Making a curved pattern that follows where the arrow actually will go/hit the target
OR calculate angle bw player and target, increase/decrease angle if line based on that position
	How to do this:
		Get distance from the target
		Find what distance lands normal line in the middle of the target, further than that angle the line downward, 		closer angle upwards
		Ex - distance 5 is mid point, no angle, distance 1 requires angle up of 4, distance 10 requires angle down of 		5?

Needed for game:
Environmental art assets
Art assets for the targets, bow, and arrows
SFX for arrows shooting, hitting the target, and hitting the ground
Music
Shooting animation
